# Prepare annotated images for training

When some images of our webcams are annotated they are saved in two different directories:

- input/imgs/\*.png
- input/masks/\*.png

For better training results we use this images and create more images by something called 'albumentation'. 

Prepare python environment for training of our neuronal networks
